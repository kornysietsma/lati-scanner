# Language-Agnostic Toxicity Indicators

This application scans source code directories, looking for measures that can be
useful for identifying toxic code.

I prefer to call these "indicators" rather than "metrics" as many of them are not precise enough
to really warrant the name "metrics" - they are ways of identifying bad code, but not a metric
you'd want to use in any scientific way.

(This is a work-in-progress port of my previous clojure projects `cloc2flare` and soon some others)

Current indicators produced:

- loc - lines of code - uses the [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) library to produce lines of code and other stats for many programming languages

more to come!
