# Polyglot Code Scanner

This is part of my Polyglot Code tools - for the main documentation, see <https://polyglot.korny.info>

## Intro

This application scans source code directories, identifying a range of code metrics and other data, and storing the results in a JSON file for later visualisation by the [Polyglot Code Explorer](https://polyglot.korny.info/tools/explorer/description/)

## Installation and running

See also <https://polyglot.korny.info/tools/scanner/howto> for more detailed instructions for fetching binary releases, and running the scanner.

To compile and run from source, you'll need [to install rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then from a copy of this project, you can build a binary package with:

~~~sh
$ cargo build --release
~~~

The binary will be built in the `target/release` directory.

### Running from source

You can also just run it from the source directory with `cargo run polyglot_code_scanner -- (other command line arguments)` - this will be slower as it runs un-optimised code with more debug information.  But it's a lot faster for development.

### Getting help

See <https://polyglot.korny.info> for the main documentation for this project.

You can get up-to-date command-line help by running

```sh
polyglot_code_scanner -h
```

## Ignoring files

Git ignored files in `.gitignore` are not scanned.

You can also manually add `.polyglot_code_scanner_ignore` files anywhere in the codebase, to list extra files to be ignored - the syntax is [the same as .gitignore's](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)

## Usage

~~~text
polyglot_code_scanner [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [root]

USAGE:
    polyglot_code_scanner [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [root]

FLAGS:
    -c, --coupling           include temporal coupling data
    -h, --help               Prints help information
        --no-detailed-git    Don't include detailed git information - output may be big!
    -V, --version            Prints version information
    -v, --verbose            Logging verbosity, v = error, vv = warn, vvv = info (default), vvvv = debug, vvvvv = trace

OPTIONS:
        --coupling-bucket-days <bucket_days>
            how many days are reviewed for one "bucket" of temporal coupling [default: 91]

        --years <git_years>
            how many years of git history to parse - default only scan the last 3 years (from now, not git head)
            [default: 3]
        --coupling-min-ratio <min_coupling_ratio>
            what is the minimum ratio of (other file changes)/(this file changes) to include a file in coupling stats
            [default: 0.25]
        --coupling-source-days <min_source_days>
            how many days should a file change in a bucket for it to generate coupling stats [default: 10]

    -o, --output <output>
            Output file, stdout if not present, or not used if sending to web server


ARGS:
    <root>    Root directory, current dir if not present

## Why rust?

1. I wanted to play with rust - I havent used a compiled language since the '90s, and I haven't used a strongly typed language I liked for a long time
2. [Tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) is awesome - and removes a key dependenency on `cloc` of my old code
3. It's nice to ditch the JVM dependency for building a generally useful tool

## Why did you fork tokei?

I want to generate indentation ignoring comments. Comments distort metrics. Tokei will recognise comments but it just gives stats, not code with the comments removed. So for now, I've forked tokei
to let me do this. I'm not sure if this will remain a fork, or if
it is something that could be merged back into tokei.
