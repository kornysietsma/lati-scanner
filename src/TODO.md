# TODO

## Small things:
* integration test
* move functionality from main to lib
* Rename so we can add more metrics than `cloc`
* publish to github
* integrate with JS UI

## Bigger things
* Basic git stats (owners, most recent change)
* * does this mean needing the git log thing? That's complex
* * could for now look at doing what `code-maat` does.
* indent stats (with or without comments depending on the next bit)
* tokei-based calculations that ignore comments - might need a tokei fork! Or can we pilfer bits of tokei?

## Future stuff
* method identification?
* deep git stats
